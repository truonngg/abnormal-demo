## Key Characteristics of Good Status Page Updates

### Tone
- Professional and empathetic
- Direct and honest without over-sharing
- Avoid technical jargon
- Focus on customer impact, not internal details

### Structure
- **Title**: Clear, concise description of the issue
- **Status**: Investigating | Identified | Monitoring | Resolved
- **Message**: 
  - What is happening (customer-observable symptoms)
  - What is affected
  - What we are doing about it
  - When to expect next update or resolution

### What to Include
- Customer-facing symptoms ("slower response times", "delayed emails")
- Affected functionality or features
- Estimated resolution time (if known) or next update timing
- Workarounds (if available)

### What to Exclude
- Internal system names (unless customer-facing)
- Technical root cause details ("connection pool exhaustion", "Redis cache miss")
- Blame or specific engineer names
- Speculation or unconfirmed information
- Overly technical metrics ("p99 latency 15s" → "significantly slower response times")

### Status Definitions

- **Investigating**: We are aware of the issue and working to identify the cause
- **Identified**: We know what's wrong and are implementing a fix
- **Monitoring**: Fix is deployed, we're watching to ensure it's working
- **Resolved**: Issue is fixed and system is stable

### Update Frequency

- Initial acknowledgment: Within 15-30 minutes of detection
- Regular updates: Every 30-60 minutes during active incidents
- Final resolution notice: Once system is stable for sufficient time
